Server-Side APIs Challenge: Weather Dashboard
Description
This Weather Dashboard application allows travelers to check the weather outlook for multiple cities, helping them plan their trips accordingly. It utilizes third-party APIs, specifically the OpenWeather API, to retrieve weather data for cities and displays both current and future weather conditions.
Usage
Visit the Weather Dashboard deployed on GitHub Pages.

Enter the name of the city you want to check the weather for in the search bar and click the "Search" button.

The dashboard will display the current weather conditions for the city, including the city name, date, weather icon, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

Below the current conditions, you will find a 5-day weather forecast, showing the date, weather icon, temperature, wind speed, and humidity for each day.

The searched city is added to the search history on the left side of the dashboard. You can click on any city in the search history to view its current and future weather conditions.
